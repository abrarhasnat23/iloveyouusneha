    <h1>I'm the Sun, and You're the Moon</h1>
    <div id="poem">
        <div class="line">We’ve never met, but I think about you.</div>
        <div class="line">I wake up every day, and for some reason,</div>
        <div class="line">I feel like you’re out there, somewhere, maybe thinking of me too.</div>
        <div class="line">I try to shine a little brighter, but I’m not sure why,</div>
        <div class="line">Maybe hoping you’ll notice, maybe hoping you’ll find me.</div>
        <div class="line">I smile even though you’re not here.</div>
        <div class="line">It feels like you’re close, even though I know you’re not.</div>
        <div class="line">I don’t really understand it, but something in my chest feels full,</div>
        <div class="line">Like there’s a space inside me that only you could fit into.</div>
        <div class="line">I find myself imagining what it would be like—</div>
        <div class="line">To sit with you, to laugh, to just be.</div>
        <div class="line">We’re like two stars in different parts of the sky,</div>
        <div class="line">Shining, but never in the same place.</div>
        <div class="line">I wait, and I wish, and I wonder if you’re out there too.</div>
        <div class="line">Maybe one day, we’ll finally meet and it’ll feel like home.</div>
        <div class="line">But until then, I’ll hold on to this thought,</div>
        <div class="line">That even if we never cross paths, I’ll still carry you with me.</div>
        <div class="line">You’re the quiet thought that gets me through the day.</div>
        <div class="line">Even if you’re not here, you’re still somehow with me.</div>
    </div>
